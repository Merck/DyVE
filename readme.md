# Dynamics of Value Evolution

A nascent computational framework for learning, designing, integrating, simulating, and optimizing R&D process models, to better inform strategic decisions in science and business. 

Provides a class of reaction network-type problems formalized with the aid of [generalized algebraic theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/generalized+algebraic+theory), featuring rich [SciML](https://sciml.ai/) integration.
