A nascent computational framework for learning, designing, integrating, simulating, and optimizing R&D process models, to better inform strategic decisions in science and business. 

As of now, a reaction network-type problem formalized on top of [generalized algebraic theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/generalized+algebraic+theory) with a complex [SciML](https://sciml.ai/) integration.
